Task
You need to implement basic matching engine:
1. implementation should provide ability to send order, get orderbook/tradehistory, get
single order by ID.
2. You can imagine the Instrument Pair BTC/USD pair for this.
3. Market and Limit Order minimum support.
4. Need to have good concurrency management

Guidance
1. Use maven as building tool
2. Don’t use any third party libraries/frameworks (only Java SE)
3. Don’t use any persistence storage (only in-memory data structures)
4. Provide tests if necessary (for tests you can use third-party libraries)
5. Solution should thrive for low latency and low GC.
